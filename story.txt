Once upon a time there was a human named Ben. He was a student taking a
computer programming class at an expensive university. Ben was very sad,
as this programming class was taking up way too much of his time with 
excessive amounts of assignments that took too much time to complete with 
insufficient amounts of educational value to compensate. Ben was also taking 
several other computer science classes that also took up a lot of time, so
these excessive assignments bothered him deeply.
